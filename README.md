# Spectre

> Can't see through the crowd? Spectre is a client-side mod that enhances visual clarity in dense situations by rendering nearby entities as translucent ghosts.

## The Problem

Ever been stuck in a tiny mineshaft with your friends, completely unable to see what you're mining? Or maybe you've built a massive mob farm, but the sheer number of monsters makes it impossible to spot and collect the loot. In entity-dense environments, your screen can become a chaotic mess.

## The Solution: See Through the Crowd

Spectre is a client-side mod for Minecraft 1.12.2 that solves this problem. It turns nearby entities (players, mobs, etc.) into semi-transparent "ghosts," allowing you to see right through them. This declutters your view, making it easy to navigate tight spaces, find your target, or pick up items on the ground.

While the primary goal is to improve your gameplay experience, this simplified rendering may also provide a slight performance improvement.

## Features

*   **Enhanced Visual Clarity:** See through other players and mobs to easily navigate crowded areas.
*   **Loot Visibility:** No more losing track of valuable drops in the middle of a massive mob farm.
*   **Highly Configurable:** Fine-tune the mod to your liking with an in-game configuration screen.
    *   Enable or disable the ghost effect for players and other entities separately.
    *   Adjust the distance at which entities turn into ghosts.
    *   Set the exact transparency level (alpha) of the ghosts.
*   **Compatibility:** Support mod render layers.
